			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				Base Logic is a fundamentally interpreted language that uses symbols as simple instructions.
			</p>

			<br><br>
			<h2>Goals</h2>
			<p>
				The primary goal was to take BF, a popular "standard", and make it more fun by adding tons
				of useful functionality to it.
			</p>

		<p style="width: 30%">Base Logic is old and does have a finished build, however it will (probably) not be
			published until I clean it up (its old).</p>
