			<h2>Interests</h2>
			<p>
				Programming lower level languages like C/C++ and more recently Rust are my most
				prominent interests. I've always wanted to create applications that users can program with
				for learning or for fun. I am a strong beliver in open source projects and all of my publicly released
				applications are open source. Graphics, shaders, and parallel processing have also always
				fascinated me.
			</p>

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p>
				My most important project, Unnamed Blocks, is my most recent and the largest project I've ever
				attepted (with a friend). It is licenced under GPL 3.0 (GNU General Public Licence), this is so people
				can generaly do whatever they want with it. Base Logic is a previous project where the user uses
				symbols as instructions.
